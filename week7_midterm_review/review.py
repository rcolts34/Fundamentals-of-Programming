#### Number Guessing Game ####
    ### Choose a target value , ask the user to guess the value
    ### Display whether the number is greater than or less than the target value and ask user to guess again
    ###  Ex:  Too low!
    ###         Too High!
    ### Keep Track of number of guesses.  If guesses are > 02.19.24 (Midterm Review)  â†’  The user loses
    ### Ask the user whether they want to continue the game.  Repeat the above if yes
