o	Repository
•	First thing → Readme document
o	Every push to commit should have a message
o	Pull
•	getting code
o	Commit
•	Records changes to one or more files in branch
o	Push
•	Act of sending or uploading code from a local source code branch to branch in remote
o	Clone
•	Copy the repository from a github to your local machine
o	Merge
•	Combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history
•	First Computer
o	Charles Babbage
•	1823 - Difference Engine
	Up to 8 decimals
•	Analytical Engine
	Up to 50 decimals
o	Ada Lovelace
•	Assistant to Charles Babbage
	Wrote first ever computer program
•	Calculate Bernoulli numbers
o	Recursion
•	Method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
•	Reusing same code
	Factorials
	Fibonacci series
o	Punch Card
•	Coding Sheets
•	Keypunch operators to punch the cars
•	Each statement needs a card
	a=2
	b=3
	a+b

o	Programming languages
    •	Computer Languages
    	Low Level Language
        •	Machines Language
        •	Binary
        •	2+3
        •	00000010   00101011  00000011
    	Middle Level Language
        •	Assembly Language
        •	Translator or Assembler
        •	Converts mnemonics into binary code
        •	Use mnemonics
        •	Add A B
        •	Every platform has certain mnemonics
        •	Platform → OS + processor
        •	Intel 8085 → Add  → 1011
        •	Intel 8086 → Plus→ 1001
        •	CON
        •	Platform dependent
    	High Level Language
        •	Use Interpreter , Compiler, or Both
        •	    Those that use both → Hybrid Languages
        •	Interpreter → Python
            •	Takes one line at a time and converts to machine code (binary)
            •	Doesn't check for syntax errors
            •	If it finds an error, stops interpreting
            •	1000 lines of code, error on 900th line, will stop
            •	Fast if code is good
        •	Compiler → C
            •	Tries to convert entire code to machine code all at once
            •	100 lines of code, error on 900th line, keeps going, makes an error list
            •	Slower, but shows errors
        •	Hybrid → Java
            •	Until recently, one of most popular languages
            •	.java
            •	Have to install Java runtime environment (JRE) to run .java
            •	When .java file is run , .class file class created, if no errors, machine code created and executed
            •	.java → .class → machine code
            •	English-like
